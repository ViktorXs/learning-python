# Learning Python (PAUSED for undefined time. Please read the changelog below.
Created this repo for learning the use of git and GitHub together with the german Udemy course "Python Bootcamp".

I am using the Python Anaconda Package and for the beginning mostly the notebook feature.

I decided to note down finished Lessons and major updates, instead of every chapter from the lessons in the changelog below.

## Note!
There will be differencies and varying things in this project, like different naming conventions of files and folder structures aswell different codestyles.
Finished things that may have wrong naming conventions etc. I will still keep them as they are and will not change for the sake of keeping track, how well I already progressed and learned python.
